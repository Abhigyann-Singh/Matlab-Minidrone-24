# **Matlab-Minidrone-24** 🚁  

### **Final Submission for Matlab Minidrone India 2024**  

## 🔹 **Overview**  
This project showcases a **vision-based navigation system** for a minidrone, designed to detect and follow a predefined **line path** using real-time **image processing** and a **robust control algorithm**.  

## 🎯 **Key Features**  

✅ **Vision-Based Navigation**: Utilizes an **RGB camera** for **line detection** and tracking.  
✅ **Advanced Image Processing**: Implements techniques like **Hough Transforms** and **color thresholding** for accurate path recognition.  
✅ **PID-Based Control**: Integrates a **PID controller** to dynamically adjust drone movements based on **real-time feedback**.  

## ⚙ **Technologies Used**  

- **MATLAB & Simulink** for algorithm development and simulation.    
- **Image Processing Toolbox** for real-time vision-based tracking.  
- **Control System Toolbox** for PID implementation and tuning.
