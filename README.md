# Matlab-Minidrone-24

Final Submission for Matlab Minidrone India 24

- Developed a vision-based navigation system using an RGB camera to detect and track a predefined line path, leveraging
image processing techniques such as Hough Transforms and color thresholding.
â€“ Designed and implemented a robust control algorithm for precise line-following, incorporating a PID controller to adjust
drone movements dynamically based on real-time feedback.
